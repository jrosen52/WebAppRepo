CS441 sixth Assignment

For our sixth project, we were assigned with making a game where the score can be placed on a database. For my game, I decided 
to keep it simple and created a target tapping game. It was a good opportunity to combine some concepts learned from the graphing
game and the animation game. There are 3 main classes: CanvasClass, ScorePage, and MainActivity. MainActivity is the central class
and contains the network connections, CanvasClass creates the main tapping game, and ScorePage is where the high score is displayed.
Hypothetically I can get scores from the web database as well with a JSON call, but to be honest I wasn't really sure how to
test this.

Here is a documentation of each git commit:
